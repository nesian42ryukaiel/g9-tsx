# G9

## Basics

This SPA is an academic website copy meant to look like a generic SNS.

## Creation

G9 requires `React`, `Redux`, and `TypeScript` to run properly. It basically follows a MVC structure; to be precise, builds upon early Flux structure by using a React-Redux basic framework combination.

Also, it runs in tandem with an `Express.js` based `Node.js` runtime server; it handles all meaningful data from elsewhere (not included). This app, which is the SPA client portion of the whole picture, tries to run as a strict View with as less extra logic as possible.

## Comments

Personally, finishing this project was incredibly helpful to me during inception, as it taught me other important Front-End skills other than JS, especially modern CSS core concepts such as Media Query, variable naming, Grid layout and more.

After the initial project (not public) was done in ES6 JavaScript, it was manually ported to TypeScript (this version) then bundled with Webpack.
